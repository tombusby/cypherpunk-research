# Luke-jr

Currently holds the number 7 position on the [bitcoin/bitcoin contributors list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors). Appears to hold some unusual views that include a belief in a geocentric model of the solar system. Very controversial figure to the Big Block camp. He was also in trouble for packaging address blocklists by default into the bitcoin package he maintained for one of the linux distros. He stated that the blocklist should have be optional and wasn't meant to be enabled by default.
